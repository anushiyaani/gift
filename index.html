         <p> ~ heyy My love, on this Lovers Day, I want to pour my heart into words that still feel too small compared to the depth of what I feel for you. You are the melody that makes my soul dance, the warmth that turns ordinary days into golden memories, and the gentle strength that reminds me I am never alone. Every glance from you feels like a promise, every touch like a prayer answered, and every laugh like sunlight breaking through clouds. Loving you is not just a feeling—it is my greatest blessing, my sweetest truth, and my most beautiful journey. I cherish the way your presence colors my world, turning silence into poetry and moments into eternity. If I could gather all the stars, I would spell your name across the sky, so the universe itself would know the brilliance of your love. Today and always, I am yours—completely, endlessly, and joyfully</p>
